This is source code inspired from the code taken from _Code Your Own
Neural Network_ by Steven C. Shaffer. I've cleaned it up and adapted
it to Go, as it was easier to do a port from C to understand what was
happening under the hood.

You shouldn't be using this for anything, and as such, there is no
license.
